# SuperMarketAnalysis
Machine Learning Project analysis on Super Market data

## Overview

I have done my pilot project on Super Market Analysis using Linear regression model in Machine Learning. Done the basic operations and checked whether the dataset has null values or not. The dataset is divided into two different parts as train and test the data. The LinearRegression model is trained to the dataset. predicted the output. used the Jupyter Notebook for programming interface and selected dataset from kaggle.
## Dependencies
* Linear Regression Algorithm
* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib
* scikit-learn

Install missing dependencies using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)

### Libraries
* model_selection library 
* Pyplot library 
* accuracy_score library 
* scatter plots 
* distplots. 


## Dataset

Install the dataset using [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aungpyaeap/supermarket-sales)

## Usage
Run the commands using python programming language
